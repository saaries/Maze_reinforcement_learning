# Maze_reinforcement_learning

Use Q-Learning and SARSA to solve maze problem generated randomly

IMPORTANT: comment the env.render() can obtain results quicker (rendering surely much slower than CPU staffssssss).

- gym_maze: the gym library for generating experiment environment 

- How to run? Simply run .py that has a main function

- Why it's a mess? I changed the value of a lot of parameters to do experiments.

- Any innovation point? See the last part in the report.

- the lr=xxx folders? Stored the experiment result.

I think you can find everything you need in my report.
